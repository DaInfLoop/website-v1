            <h1>Hey.</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I'm Haroon - although loads of people online know me by my alias: DaInfLoop. I'm a community moderator by
                day and programmer by night&hellip; although that's probably not the most important thing right now.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>What do I do?</h2>
            <p>I do many things online - whether it be moderating online communities or making random things nobody
                asked for. Examples of the latter being <a
                    href="https://github.com/DaInfLoop/ScamGuard-Reporter">ScamGuard Reporter</a>, <a
                    href="https://replit.com/@repltv">repl.tv</a> and <a
                    href="https://github.com/DaInfLoop/jspy">jspy</a>. Am I proud of these? Probably. Would anyone find
                any use in them? Probably not.</p>
            <p>Examples of the former are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Battle Master Universe - I've been a moderator there since October 2020, and currently the Head
                    Moderator of the server.</li>
                <li>Friends of Replit(?) - I joined the FoR team in July 2023, also helping moderate and managing the
                    Minecraft server "nestled" alongside it from October 2023 to its shutdown in September 2024.</li>
                <li>Playroom - I joined the Playroom moderation team in May 2024, and joined the Game Master team the
                    next month: hosting bi-weekly game sessions of their game <a href="https://deathbyai.gg">Death by
                        AI.</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>How do I contact you?</h2>
            <p>Great question. <span class="strike">I have no clue.</span></p>
            <p>You can DM me on Discord (I have friend requests open!) at <code>dainfloop</code>.</p>
            <p>You can also email me at <code><span id="email"></span></code>, although barely anyone uses email
                nowadays&hellip; right?</p>
        </div>
